            <section>
                <h4>About my role</h4>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        I contribute to Moon Design System by taking full ownership of the Moon React Components
                        Library,
                        one of the core tools powering multiple internal products at Yolo Group. My main responsibility
                        is
                        to design, build, and maintain scalable, reusable, and accessible React components, following
                        the
                        Composition Pattern and SOLID principles to ensure a clean, extensible, and maintainable
                        architecture.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I joined the project, I focused on understanding the existing pain points of the previous
                        library version — such as limited scalability, poor maintainability, and tight coupling. By
                        rebuilding the entire library from scratch, I introduced a modular structure that allows
                        developers
                        to compose complex interfaces more efficiently while keeping the codebase easier to test,
                        extend,
                        and evolve.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To enhance developer experience and project scalability, I also built a custom CLI tool that
                        enables
                        teams to install only the components they need. This innovation reduced the initial setup time
                        by
                        80% and significantly improved maintainability, allowing internal teams to integrate Moon
                        components
                        directly into their codebases and customize them according to specific project requirements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My work goes beyond writing code — it involves collaborating closely with designers, engineers,
                        and
                        stakeholders to ensure the design system aligns with brand consistency, accessibility standards,
                        and
                        long-term technical goals. I actively participate in code reviews, contribute to improving
                        documentation, and promote best practices for component-driven development.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project has been a great opportunity to combine my passion for frontend architecture,
                        design
                        systems, and developer experience. I enjoy crafting solutions that not only look great but also
                        scale well and empower other teams to build faster and with more confidence.
